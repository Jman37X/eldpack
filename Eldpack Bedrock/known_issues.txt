Eldpack Continued - Bedrock Edition | Known Issues
==================================================
This document covers known issues in Eldpack Continued - Bedrock Edition v0.0.1.

The short list:
- UI differences
- Missing things
- Some blocks don't animate
- Items that should animate don't
- Missing textures for Bedrock-specific stuff
- Observer texture issue

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UI differences
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Bedrock Edition UI is considerably different than the Java Edition.
It will take a while for the UI to be ported, though with the existence of
https://mcpedl.com/vanilla-deluxe-mixed-ui/
it seems possible to do...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Missing things
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- horse hearts
many other things that i haven't bothered checking for

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some blocks don't animate
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a fixable issue. However, since the animation syntax differs between
Java and Bedrock, I cannot guarantee 1:1 translations of animation sequences.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items that should animate don't
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was unable to get items to animate via flipbook_textures.json.
Unsure if this is intended, or if it's a bug.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Missing textures for Bedrock-specific stuff
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- arrow of decay
- potions (bedrock has a different texture system that's a pain)
- anything for Education Edition
probably tons of other things as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Observer texture issue
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One of the Observer sides is displayed upside down.
Unsure if this is a bug in the original terrain_texture.json or not.
