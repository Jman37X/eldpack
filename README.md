Eldpack Continued
=================
[**Thread on Minecraft Forum**](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/resource-packs/1243614-eldpack-continued-1-13-16x)

This is a continuation of the [Eldpack](https://eldpack.com/) resource pack for Minecraft.

Currently, it is only available for Java Edition, but a Bedrock Edition version
of the resource pack is also under development.

(todo: better README)

- The "Eldpack Continued" directory contains the texture pack for v1.19.
- The "old_stuff" directory contains the contents of the repository before v1.14.
- An older WIP v1.14 port is available on the "dev" branch (as of this writing). Some contents from this version have been merged back into the main branch.
